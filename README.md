# Book Recommendation App

<b> Project: </b> Build a recommender system that could update recommendations based on read books stored by user in a database.

I listen to a lot of audiobooks and often find myself seeking out "similar books" as soon as I finish one so I am constantly looking for new books to read. Usually the best recommendations come from my husband, who reads a lot of the same books as I do but I figured I could find more books if I extend that pool of 'similar readers'. A book recommender system seemed a logical first step. 

I started with the ...  dataset compiled by in order to build recommender system. These data include both implicit ratings and explicit ratings. In this case, explicit ratings are actual ratings of books on a scale of 1 - 10 indictated the extent to which the user enjoyed the book. Implict readings are simply 'yes/no'; did this user read this book? While implicit ratings are much easier to gather from users, I choose to base my recommender off of explicit ratings so that it was easier to rank the recommendations from 'most likely to be enjoyed' to 'least likely to be enjoyed'.
